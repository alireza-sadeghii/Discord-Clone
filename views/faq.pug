                h3 What is this Discord project about?
                div.answer
                    p This project is a communication and collaboration platform
                        |  that allows users to create and join servers for voice, video,
                        |  and text chat. The main goal is to learn about WebRTC, WebSocket,
                        |  and server-side technologies to facilitate real-time communication
                        |  and community building.

                h3 How do servers and channels work?
                div.answer
                    p Servers are virtual spaces where users can interact. Each server
                        |  is organized into channels, which can be dedicated to text, voice,
                        |  or video. Users can join channels to participate in discussions
                        |  or group calls based on their interests.
            div.faq-card
                h3 Can users create their own servers?
                div.answer
                    p Yes, users can create their own servers, customize them with roles,
                        |  permissions, and channels, and invite others to join. This allows
                        |  for personalized communities tailored to specific interests or goals.

                h3 Is it possible to add bots to servers?
                div.answer
                    p Yes, servers can include bots to automate tasks, moderate channels,
                        |  or provide additional functionality, such as music streaming,
                        |  games, or custom commands. Bots can be added using APIs or bot marketplaces.

                h3 Can users join multiple servers?
                div.answer
                    p Yes, users can join multiple servers and easily switch between them.
                        |  Each server operates independently, with its own set of members,
                        |  roles, and permissions, allowing users to participate in multiple
                        |  communities at the same time.

                        |  Private messaging supports text, file sharing, voice, and video calls,
                        |  making one-on-one communication seamless.
